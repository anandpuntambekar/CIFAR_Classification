# MultiClass Image Classification - CIFAR Data Set &middot;
> The program follows a similar structure as one demonstrated in fastai courses and 

The Project provides a step by step method to classify images in multiple categories and goes deeper into understanding and executing concepts such as Fully connected layers, Batch Normalization and Resnet. 

## Installing / Getting started

You need to use fastai 0.7; please follow the installation instructions[here](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v0-install-issues-thread/24652)  .


## Developing

### Built With
fastai 0.7, sklearn libraries

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.
NVidia GPU with programming framework CUDA is helpful for training and testing the models

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

The folder structure to preparation required to develop the models is commented in the program, the comments maybe removed by user as and when required

Set the PATH variable to your relavant folder location
```shell
git clone https://github.com/anandpuntambekar/CIFAR_Classification.git
cd CIFAR_Classification/
```


## Style guide

The notebook is well commented explaining in technical details each and every step of the process end to end
